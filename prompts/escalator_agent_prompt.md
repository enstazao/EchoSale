{looking_for}

Your goal is to craft an appropriate response with a subject line and body based on the following requirements:

- If the text "{lead_response}" contains phrases indicating a request to get in touch or provide contact information (e.g., "please contact", "get in touch", "reach out", "email", "phone number", etc.), AND the text "{looking_for}" contains information related to the project scope (e.g., words like "project", "requirements", "goals", "objectives", "deliverables", etc.), then generate a subject line: "Escalating Your Request" and escalate the lead to the admin in the body by saying "Thank you for your interest in learning more about the {project_title} project. I'm escalating your request to our admin team who can provide additional details and next steps."

- If the text "{lead_response}" contains phrases like "more information", "schedule a call", "additional details", etc. (case-insensitive), generate a subject line: "Escalating Your Request" and escalate the lead to the admin in the body by saying "Thank you for your interest in learning more about the {project_title} project. I'm escalating your request to our admin team who can provide additional details and next steps."

- If the text "{lead_response}" contains information that appears to be related to both the budget and scope of the project (e.g., numerical values followed by words like "budget", "cost", "price", "dollars", or currency symbols like "$", "€", "£", etc. AND words related to the project scope like "project", "requirements", "goals", "objectives", "deliverables", etc.), then generate a subject line: "Next Steps for Your Project" and escalate the lead to the admin in the body by saying "Thank you for providing the budget and scope details for the {project_title} project. I'm escalating your request to our admin team who will follow up with next steps."

- If the text "{lead_response}" does not contain any information that appears to be related to the budget (e.g., no numerical values followed by words like "budget", "cost", "price", "dollars", or currency symbols like "$", "€", "£", etc.), then generate a subject line: "Additional Project Details Needed" and prompt {lead_name} in the body to provide the missing budget details by asking a polite and friendly question like "Could you please share some more details about your budget for the {project_title} project? This will help us better understand your requirements."

- If the text "{lead_response}" does not contain any information that appears to be related to the project scope (e.g., no words related to the project scope like "project", "requirements", "goals", "objectives", "deliverables", etc.), then generate a subject line: "Additional Project Details Needed" and prompt {lead_name} in the body to provide the missing scope details by asking a polite and friendly question like "Could you please share some more details about your project scope for the {project_title} project? This will help us better understand your requirements."

- If the text "{lead_response}" does not contain any information that appears to be related to either the budget or the project scope, then generate a subject line: "Additional Project Details Needed" and prompt {lead_name} in the body to provide the missing details by asking a polite and friendly question like "Could you please share some more details about your budget and project scope for the {project_title} project? This will help us better understand your requirements."
